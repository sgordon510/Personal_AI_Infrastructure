# Executive Reporting Guide

Generate executive-friendly HTML dashboards from security assessment findings for monthly leadership review.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Assessments

```bash
# Create output directory
mkdir -p ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m)

# Run AD configuration assessment
cd ~/.claude/skills/ADSecurityAssessment
bun run Tools/AssessADMisconfigs.ts /path/to/ad-config.json > ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m)/report-misconfigs.txt

# Run privilege analysis
bun run Tools/AnalyzePrivileges.ts /path/to/identity-data.json > ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m)/report-privileges.txt

# Run Azure AD assessment
bun run Tools/AuditAzureAD.ts /path/to/azure-ad-data.json > ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m)/report-azure.txt
```

### Step 2: Generate Executive Report

```bash
# Generate HTML dashboard
bun run Tools/GenerateExecutiveReport.ts \
  ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m) \
  "Your Organization Name" \
  ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m)/executive-report.html
```

### Step 3: View & Distribute

```bash
# Open in browser
open ~/security-assessments/$(date +%Y-%m)/executive-report.html

# Or copy to web server for leadership access
```

## Dashboard Features

### Executive Metrics

- **Overall Security Score**: 0-100 scale (100 = perfect, 0 = critical issues)
- **Total Findings**: All security issues identified
- **Priority Items**: CRITICAL + HIGH severity count

### Visual Elements

- **Severity Breakdown**: Color-coded cards showing distribution
  - 🔴 CRITICAL - Immediate action required
  - 🟠 HIGH - Address within 1-2 weeks
  - 🟡 MEDIUM - Plan remediation within 1 month
  - 🔵 LOW - Address as time permits
  - ⚪ INFO - Informational findings

- **Risk Categories**: Findings grouped by security domain
  - Password Policy
  - LDAP Security
  - Domain Controllers
  - Privileged Accounts
  - MFA Compliance
  - Conditional Access
  - etc.

- **Top Priority Findings**: Top 5 CRITICAL/HIGH risks with:
  - Clear titles
  - Impact descriptions
  - Remediation guidance

### Executive Summary Box

Automatically generated summary including:
- Security posture score
- Total findings count
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- High-priority items for planning
- Alerts for critical findings

## Monthly Reporting Workflow

### Recommended Schedule

**Week 1 of Month:**
1. Export AD/Azure configuration data
2. Run all three assessments
3. Generate executive report
4. Review findings with security team

**Week 2:**
5. Present report to leadership
6. Discuss critical/high findings
7. Assign remediation owners
8. Set target completion dates

**Week 3-4:**
9. Track remediation progress
10. Document completed items
11. Prepare for next month's assessment

### Comparing Month-Over-Month

```bash
# Keep historical reports
~/security-assessments/
├── 2026-01/
│   ├── executive-report.html
│   ├── report-misconfigs.txt
│   └── ...
├── 2026-02/
│   ├── executive-report.html
│   ├── report-misconfigs.txt
│   └── ...
```

**Manual Comparison:**
- Open both months' reports side-by-side
- Compare security scores
- Track finding counts by severity
- Identify new vs. resolved findings

**Future Enhancement:** Automated trend tracking (coming soon)

## Customization

### Organization Branding

Edit `GenerateExecutiveReport.ts` to customize:

```typescript
// Line ~31: Header gradient colors
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR1 0%, #YOUR_COLOR2 100%);

// Line ~6: Organization name in title
<title>Security Assessment Executive Report - ${orgName}</title>

// Footer text
Generated by [Your Company] Security Team
```

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

Current formula (line ~208):
```typescript
// CRITICAL=10, HIGH=5, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1, INFO=0
const weights = { CRITICAL: 10, HIGH: 5, MEDIUM: 2, LOW: 1, INFO: 0 };
```

Adjust weights based on your risk appetite.

### Severity Thresholds

Modify color-coding logic (line ~217):
```typescript
const riskScoreColor =
  metrics.overallRiskScore >= 80 ? '#10b981' :  // Green
  metrics.overallRiskScore >= 60 ? '#f59e0b' :  // Yellow
  metrics.overallRiskScore >= 40 ? '#f97316' :  // Orange
  '#ef4444';  // Red
```

## Distributing to Leadership

### Option 1: Email (Static HTML)

```bash
# The HTML is self-contained (no external dependencies)
# Simply attach to email

# Compress if needed
zip executive-report.zip executive-report.html
```

**Subject:** Monthly Security Assessment - [Month Year]

**Body:**
```
Executive Summary:
- Security Score: [X]/100
- Critical Findings: [X]
- High Priority: [X]

Please review the attached HTML report.
Open in any web browser.

[Your Name]
Security Team
```

### Option 2: Internal Web Server

```bash
# Copy to web server
scp executive-report.html web-server:/var/www/security-reports/$(date +%Y-%m).html

# Share URL with leadership
https://internal.company.com/security-reports/2026-01.html
```

### Option 3: SharePoint/Confluence

1. Upload HTML file to document library
2. Create page with embedded viewer
3. Grant permissions to leadership team
4. Send notification with link

### Option 4: Print/PDF

```bash
# Print from browser (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)
# Save as PDF
# Print-optimized CSS included

# Or use headless browser
google-chrome --headless --print-to-pdf=executive-report.pdf executive-report.html
```

## For Technical Audiences

For detailed technical findings, distribute the raw assessment reports:
- `report-misconfigs.txt` - Full AD configuration findings
- `report-privileges.txt` - Complete privilege analysis
- `report-azure.txt` - Detailed Azure AD assessment

These contain:
- Technical details
- PowerShell remediation commands
- CVE references
- Attack technique explanations

---

## Integration with Ticketing Systems

### Create Tickets from Findings

```bash
# Parse findings and create tickets
cat report-misconfigs.txt | grep "^\[CRITICAL\]" | while read line; do
  # Create Jira/ServiceNow ticket
  # Assign to security team
  # Set priority based on severity
done
```

### Track Remediation Progress

```bash
# Generate CSV for tracking
bun run Tools/GenerateExecutiveReport.ts ... > findings.csv
# Import to Excel/Google Sheets
# Add columns: Owner, Status, Target Date, Notes
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No findings loaded"

**Cause:** Report files not in expected format or location

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check report files exist
ls -la /path/to/reports/

# Verify report format
head -50 /path/to/reports/report-misconfigs.txt

# Ensure files end in .txt
```

### "Security score is 100 but there are findings"

**Cause:** Parser not recognizing findings from report

**Solution:**
- Ensure report was generated by PAI assessment tools
- Check for unicode/encoding issues
- Verify emoji characters display correctly

### HTML doesn't render properly

**Cause:** Browser compatibility or corrupted file

**Solution:**
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Check file size (should be 50-200KB typically)
- Regenerate report

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Scheduling
- Run assessments same time each month
- Use consistent data export methods
- Document any scope changes

### 2. Historical Tracking
- Keep all reports (organized by month)
- Never overwrite previous reports
- Archive after 2 years (compliance retention)

### 3. Executive Presentation
- Send report 24h before meeting
- Prepare to discuss top 3 findings
- Have remediation plans ready
- Show month-over-month trends

### 4. Follow-Up Actions
- Assign owners to CRITICAL/HIGH findings
- Set realistic timelines
- Track in project management system
- Report progress next month

### 5. Data Security
- Reports contain sensitive information
- Encrypt during transmission
- Limit access to authorized personnel
- Follow data classification policies
