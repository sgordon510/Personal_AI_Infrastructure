# Mission

**Your core life missions and purpose.**

Missions are your ultimate purposes - the "why" behind everything else in your TELOS system.

## Missions

### M0: Master Security & Hacking
Achieve deep expertise in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and security research to understand systems at a fundamental level and contribute to a more secure digital world.

**Why:** Security mastery requires understanding how systems actually work, not just how they're supposed to work. This knowledge compounds and applies across all technical domains.
**How:** Continuous learning through CTFs, hands-on practice, security research, and building security tools
**Timeline:** Ongoing - mastery is a lifelong pursuit

### M1: Grow Skills & Career Development
Continuously develop technical and professional capabilities to advance in the security field, building a reputation and career that provides opportunities, income, and impact.

**Why:** Skills without career growth limits impact. Career development opens doors to better challenges, compensation, and influence in the security community.
**How:** Certifications, networking, visible contributions (CTF rankings, CVEs, talks), strategic job moves
**Timeline:** Ongoing - each year should show measurable progression

### M2: [Long-term Mission]
[A longer-term mission, perhaps for later in life]

**Why:** [Why this matters]
**How:** [How you'll pursue this eventually]
**Timeline:** [When you'll focus on this]

*Review quarterly. Missions should be stable - if they change frequently, go deeper.*
