## Foundational Beliefs

### B0: Learn by Doing
Hands-on practice beats theory. You understand systems by breaking them, building them, and experimenting—not just reading about them.

**Evidence:** Every major skill breakthrough came from doing, not studying. CTF challenges teach more than textbooks.
**Implications:** Prioritize labs, projects, and practice over passive consumption. When stuck, try something instead of researching more.
**Confidence:** High

### B1: Compound Effects
Small consistent actions beat big sporadic efforts. Progress comes from daily deposits, not heroic sprints.

**Evidence:** Sporadic motivation leads to burnout and guilt. Steady habits produce surprising results over time.
**Implications:** Design systems and habits that make small daily progress automatic. Trust the process over feelings.
**Confidence:** High
